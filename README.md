# React.js course

## What is React.js

"React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started." - [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Why does this repository exist

I've created this repository to keep track of my progress on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller his React.js online-course. Each commit represents a video of his course.
